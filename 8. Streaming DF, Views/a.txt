Spark Sources

Spark Streams can read from various input sources
So far we have read from a static file using just Spark without streaming
Spark Streams have the ability to monitor folders, watching for files as they appear, and then read them in real-time
Perhaps the most flexible source to read from is Kafka, because of its ability to broker data
Another source that can be used primarily for testing is a Unix socket - we will not be going into this in the course, but it can be useful for learning
