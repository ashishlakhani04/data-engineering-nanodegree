Stream Creation

There are two options for creating streams in KSQL:

Define the stream attributes and types with a create statement
Create a stream with a select that excludes or modifies data from another stream
Creating Streams from an underlying topic requires you to specify column names and their types

You must also specify the serialization format as one of JSON, AVRO, or DELIMITED (csv)
You must also specify the underlying topic name
You may create a stream from another existing stream with CREATE STREAM <stream_name> AS SELECT â€¦
